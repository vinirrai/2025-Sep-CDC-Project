# Carolina Data Challenge 2025: Zero Gravity

**Project: Orbital Debris Tracker – 3D Space Visualization**

Using NASA TLE API on Grad Track


## About the Project

At **Carolina Data Challenge 2025**, our team wanted to explore the growing problem of **orbital debris** and make it **understandable, visual, and interactive**. Using **TLE (Two-Line Element) data**, we simulate satellite and debris trajectories in Earth’s orbit.

Our platform allows users to:

* Track satellites and debris in **real-time**
* Explore orbits in a **3D globe environment**
* Detect potential **collisions and conjunctions**
* Ask an **AI Satellite Assistant** (Gemini integration) questions about orbits and debris

---

## Features

### 3D Globe Environment

* Realistic Earth with day/night textures, atmosphere, and city lights
* Smooth globe rotation and zoom navigation

### Satellite & Debris Tracking

* TLE-based orbital propagation (via Satellite.js)
* Orbits color-coded by altitude (LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO)
* Toggle orbit trails and object labels

### Interactive Controls

* Click-to-select satellites/debris
* Search by **name or NORAD ID**
* Zoom into objects and view detailed orbital parameters

### Llama 70 Billion AI Satellite Assistant

* Ask questions like:

  * *“Where is the ISS right now?”*
  * *“Which satellites are currently in GEO?”*
  * *“Explain the difference between Line 1 and Line 2 in TLE format.”*
* Integrated securely with `.env` API key management

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/2025-Sep-CDC-Project.git
   cd 2025-Sep-CDC-Project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Setup environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```env
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser at:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Technologies Used

* **Three.js** – 3D rendering (Earth, orbits, debris)
* **Satellite.js** – TLE parsing & orbital mechanics
* **GSAP** – Animations & smooth transitions
* **Vite** – Build tool & dev server
* **Llama 70 Billion AI API** – Satellite Assistant

---

## Why This Matters

* Orbital debris is a **growing problem**: thousands of fragments threaten satellites and the ISS.
* Our tool helps **visualize, understand, and communicate** the issue in an **interactive way**.
* It can be used for **education, research, and cawareness** — making the invisible problem visible.
